                You step in from a bustling, loud, enormous city into a walkway. In front of you stretches the Hudson River,
                with the water sparkling in the sunlight. You hear the waves lapping against the side of the park, bikes zooming past, as well as dogs barking,
                people talking, and the wind blowing. The environment allows you to smell the fresh breeze, and that triumphs all of the surrounding smells.
                You walk around and touch the smooth backs of the wooden benches, the hot rail of the fence, and the many blades of grass on the fields.
                This allows you to become one with everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Look behind you and there are luscious, quiet, secluded grassy areas throughout the park,
                where people lay on just grass, blankets, towels, and even hoodies. People are either sleeping on their backs,
                staring up at the trees around them, or just taking in the bright blue sky and clouds. There are benches spread throughout the
                length of the entire park, all facing the glistening water of the Hudson River and the New Jersey skyline. At sunset, the sun is surrounded by
                multiple shades of purple, pink, blue, and red, and is eventually concealed behind tall skyscrapers.
            </p>
            <p>
                After strolling along the walkway, looking side to side from various green trees to the river,
                there is a kids' playground. A mini waterpark connected to a playground that has a spiraling ramp to run up and a blue jungle gym,
                my brother and I would always be brought there by our parents. We could play there for hours on end, just being together, me and him.
                I felt a happy, rising bubble in my stomach that just kept on getting larger every second that I spent with my brother, running around, jumping, and just having fun.

            </p>
            <p>
                Ten years later, I was walking from my house to pier forty at Hudson River Park. My heart was pounding in my chest, and different thoughts kept on
                floating throughout my brain. When my friend and I began walking down the pathway, a cool breeze enveloped my body, my mind immediately calmed,  and
                my previously tensed-up muscles just let go. This was my first interaction with someone new. Since then, Hudson River Park became the specific place I always went to meet with
                various friends, due to the fact that whenever I stepped onto the walkway of opportunities of letting go, I let go of whatever emotion was holding me down.

            </p>
            <p>
                The idea of letting go unifies all of the piers, the bike path, the walkway that goes from beginning to end, the uplands, coves, and smaller parks.
                The smaller parks are the various gardens, in which you could see a ton of different colorful flowers, plants, and occasionally insects. The main place for coming together is
                Little Island, where groups of people come to the top of the island to get a view of the skyline in Battery Park City. Especially during nighttime, the buildings stand out from the starry night sky,
                which is what makes it a magical moment of true bonding.

            </p>
            <p>
                Little Island, as well as the entire park, is one of the places where people who are divided into a series of neighborhoods can connect with one another. The Tribeca Upland, Chelsea, and Upper West Side
                are all separate areas. There is a possibility for someone living on the Upper West Side to cross paths with someone living in SoHo. Despite the divergence in each neighborhood, the park can provide the same
                experience to each visitor regardless of their background. Overall, this unifies NYC as a whole. As a result, Hudson River Park has a unique and open feel of true connection.

            </p>
            <p>
                This feeling is spread throughout the city and Hudson River Park which have their divides, but soon and again, share their similarities. A popular part of the city, SoHo, as well as
                Times Square, is the main divide.  SoHo always has crowds of people walking through the streets at all times of the day. On the other hand, Hudson River Park is sparsely populated between the piers, fields, and paths.
                There is no need to worry about where to go next.

            </p>
            <p>
                At the park, no matter where you look, you will see a majestic group of buildings or skyscrapers against the bright blue sky. This is where the city seeps into the park but still feels like home. Behind you, you can see
                layers and layers of buildings stretched out so far you can't see the end of them. Turn around, and it's calm, peaceful, water wherever you may go.

            </p>
            <p>
                The overflow of the city combined with nature is the abundant Citi bikes. Walking one mile or four, the bikes are all stationed right before the bike path. No matter where you go in NYC, you will always see a blue bike in the corner of your eye.
            </p>
            <p>
                The unification of two different “realms” of city life and nature is an escape as the bikes join you, the people, and the city, as one.
